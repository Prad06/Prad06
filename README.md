### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

MS Electrical and Computer Engineering student at Northeastern University.


With hands-on experience gained through developing data-driven solutions and optimizing machine learning pipelines, I have worked extensively in both backend development and cloud migration projects, particularly in my role as a Software Engineer at Cognizant using technologies like Python, PySpark, and Google Cloud Platform. 
I thrive in environments where I can apply my knowledge of machine learning to solve complex, real-world problems, and I am particularly drawn to opportunities that allow me to work on advanced computer vision applications. 


I am actively seeking roles in machine learning, computer vision, and related fields, where I can leverage my technical expertise and continue to grow as part of a dynamic team.
