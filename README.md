### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Pradnyesh, from India. I have a strong inclination towards Machine Learning and Data Science due to my interest in mathematics, also I enjoy web development and looking forward to expanding my expertise. For programming purposes, I'm most comfortable in Python but I'm flexible enough to code in any language. Passionate to get clued with new programming languages, software, and frameworks.
